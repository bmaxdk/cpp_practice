# Mastering Data Structures &amp; Algorithms using C and C++
Main purpose of this is to review and practice basic concept. Strong fundamental background of knowledge will reinforce usage of C++ various way.

## C++ Introduction
p1 to p12

## C++ Data Structure

### Recursion
Data is kept inside the main memory. During the execution of a program how the program will manage data inside the main memory and perform the operations is the data structure.
