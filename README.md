# Mastering Data Structures &amp; Algorithms using C and C++
Main purpose of this is to review and practice basic concept. Strong fundamental background of knowledge will reinforce usage of C++ various way.

## C++ Introduction
p1 to p12

## C++ Data Structure

### Recursion
Data is kept inside the main memory. During the execution of a program how the program will manage data inside the main memory and perform the operations is the data structure.

p13 to p22

### Array Representations
* The key here is `Double Pointer`, memory and time complexity nD array

p23 to p26

* Check double pointer works p23 to p25

### Array ADT
Data
 - Array Space
 - Size
 - Length

Operations
 - Display()
 - Add(x)/Append(x)
 - Insert(index, x)
 - Delete(index)
 - Search(x)
 - Get(index)
 - Set(index, x)
 - Max()/Min()
 - Reverse()
 - Shift()/Rotate()

p27: Display(), Add(x)/Append(x), Insert(index, x)

* It will useful to see how usage of pointer for increment such as `arr->A[arr->length++] = x;`

### Strings


### Matrices


### Sparse Matrix and Polynomial Representation
